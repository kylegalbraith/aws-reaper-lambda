# aws-reaper-lambda

This is an AWS Lambda function that will trigger everyday via an AWS CloudWatch Rule. Once fired, it lists any available EBS volumes in the region it is configured to run in. If it finds any, it deletes them.

**Disclaimer: This is a destructive operation and there is no logic built into the function to determine _if_ the available volume should be removed. You should use this function only if you are certain available volumes should _always_ be deleted. If that is not the case, you should add logic to this function to account for that or not even use it at all.**

You can check out more details on how this function can be used in this [blog post](https://www.cloudforecast.io/blog/using-serverless-reapers-to-lower-your-aws-bill/).
